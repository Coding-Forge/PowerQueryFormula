# Power BI formulas
Collection of Power Query Formulas and DAX measures and columns

> The concept for this repository is to create a place where M language formulas and DAX formulas can be aggregated, explained and provide a simple means for copying and pasting into your own Power BI measure, column or Advanced Query Editor. Please feel free to visit this site as I will be updating this over time. Also note that I will be aggregating the formulas base on topic
